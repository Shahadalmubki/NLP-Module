We are a communications company that cares about fulfilling our customers' desires and listening to their requirements.
Thus, we received many complaints about the large number of unclear messages they had, which caused a lack of distinction between ham and spam messages . To solve this problem due to the desire of our customers, we  used a set of data and artificial intelligence algorithms to create a model and training to classify messages in terms of their type, whether they are ham or spam.
